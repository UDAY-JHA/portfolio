            <p class="sec1-text" id="ujalishirt">
                Tomorrow is the most awaited day for a 1st year student , of which everyone waits for and is a symbol of
                    college supremacy. Private colleges spend a lot on … ya you guess it right its the FRESHERS party ,
                    since
                they have not much to convince innocent parents and spendthrift students.
                Beside, today is the freshers party of CSE, B.ARC & Civil.E departments. These are the departments of my
                college MANIT BHOPAL on whom the fresher was thrown by the upset seniors and frightening administration.
                The
                seniors were upset (due to their buffoon juniors) still allowed us to have a good freshers , since they
                had
                been served a bitter freshers from their seniors, they want us to have a juicy formal freshers.
                Efforts by the seniors were clear from their efforts in the practice (they were as normal as Bruce
                Banner
                for the shake of practice and like hulk when it comes to ragging ). Many came to stalk beautiful junior
                girls and many came to take intro.
                Some other responsibility of seniors include collecting funds, distributing it, being corruption less,
                make
                juniors continuously hoot and one more,,,,,, this one is a special responsibility , which gives seniors
                power to show their devil-ness, settingggggg upppppppp dress code for the juniors.
                The average seniors who don’t bother about showing their creativity , decides to make their lallu
                juniors a
                –“waiter” with a full sleeve white shirt with a black trousers and black shoes; which is not that bad.
                But
                the creative one set it as- a white shirt with a black short white socks and black formal shoes ; all
                with a
                black cap over our vacant head. The royal mechanical’s decided it.

                After the declaration of the dress code the hostel was divided in 3 groups – 1: who had all the 3 basic
                components of their waiter avatar 2: who don’t have any one or all but had decided to buy a new one. 3:
                called nalle-bikhari who don’t feel shame in begging for the outfit.
                I was a fashion enthusiast ,who lacks money to show his great fashion sense; who had a list ready for a
                lucky day when he earns his first salary to fullfill his wish of purchasing inessential luxuries. The
                list
                includes almost 20 items consisting t-shirts, shirts, some bottoms, shoes, belts , socks, eyeglass frame
                and
                wrist watches. Guess -in which group I lie.
                No yaar… I am not from 3rd group , I am from the 2nd one. Like everyone else my feets too fall directly
                in
                the new market to buy a white shirt which I don’t have. I have black shoes and a black trouser which I
                bought while coming to MANIT , I already knew it back before- that these clothings would be required in
                future.
                So I had gathered my team of fools to fetch a white shirt from new market. The team includes 2 important
                Imbeciles Maheep and Dheemant. We do not prefer such visits with both of them simultaneously since they
                could create trouble out of nowhere, could make us punched by some elder any-time, and are extremely
                annoying & irresponsible human beings.
                Now all 5 of us are strolling in new market to find a not so hi-fi and expensive shop and we found one.
                After taking 2 or 3 looks of different cotton shirts I decided to have white shirt of polymer , since it
                does not wrinkle heavily like cotton and it was very rare to find a iron in hostel at that time , but
                Dheemant had one and he lends it for 10 Rs for 1 shirt, that to we ourself has to do .I never understood
                why
                he doesn’t reduces his rate as the laundry man charges only 15Rs to wash and even iron your shirt.
                ## The para in Green color doesnot have much relation to the topic. You can skip them.
                At each shop wherever we stopped , Maheep finds an important thing hanging there and this thing deserves
                to
                be in his room not there at the shop ,so he grabs it and now the total of our bill is made to be paid by
                Maheep the Phone-pe’er(phone-payer) as he have large sum of money in his bank.
                After purchasing the shirt , we had purchased some more essentials and discovering each gali of new
                market
                made our tummy shout for some fast food of bazaar,and our holes(of nose,obviously) can smell the tasty
                aroma
                of chaat somewhere near us, then we had khasta chaat, kachodi chat, aloo chaat and some French fries and
                headed instantly towards MANIT after drinking pineapple and mausammi juice, ya it was weird to have
                juice
                after much tasty chaats but I love doing weird things.
                ##
                Now arises the problem, I had promised to give my white shirt to one of my friend long back when the
                dates
                of the party was not announced. But his freshers is tomorrow and mine is day after tomorrow yet I had to
                give him my new white shirt , which i loves too much(as I was my strategy to have a pure shite shirt and
                dress like Ranbir Kapoor of Animal , to look as handsome as him.). I had not even wore it once , what-if
                if
                he put some oil strain or chutney on it while taking to his female friends, obviously not intentionally,
                what if he had a cut on my shirt , or if the third button of my shirt fell where will I look while
                giving
                funde.

                But I agreed , by having a back-up plan in my mind. If something happens to the short we(me and saksham)
                will again visit new market and find the same shop and purchase the same shirt , and I will keep this
                new
                shirt and Saksham will take the strained one and do whatever he wants to do. It would be like he had
                strained his own newly purchased shirt and mine is safe. I don’t know whether Saksham will agree to this
                plan or not, but I believe he would agree ,maybe with a gloomy face, as he is among few persons of my
                group
                who has fully functional brain.

                The day arrives and my new shirt needed to be ironed once before being used .But it was decided not to
                give
                the laundry wale bhaiya for the obvious reasons, so I had to pay Dheemant Rs 10 and have a iron ,
                furthermore I don’t know how to iron a shirt. Don’t laugh , all of my school shirts are either ironed by
                my
                mummy or my little brother would do it for me, so I never learnt it. But Saksham knew it and has helped
                me
                to do it, as today is his turn to wear the shirt.

                I went to class in the noon , and when I returned in the evening Saksham was gone, I want to have a
                glimpse
                of my shirt(more importantly) and also Saksham(less …) how he is looking , hence I waited for him with
                the
                tention of my shirt roaming in my mind and reminding me of the negative thoughts. Although I was not
                alone
                who was waiting for my shirt , many were waiting and hoping that their friend would return their
                property in
                a fresh form without damaging it.
                …….B.arc wale bacche a gay, my ears heard these lines and I went to meet him and take my shirt back. He
                was
                tired and he returned my shirt with red eyes(he used to have red whenever he feels sleepy), lights were
                dim
                in his room , he asked me to check the shirt , if its fine or not; I had a close look at it within a
                second
                and it feels perfectly fine. But when I checked it again in my room in bright light , there were 3
                minute
                red strains of chutney at 3 different locations.
                Now the dharamsankat arises once again , what should I do now- should I try to wash it, should I message
                Saksham with the photograph of strains and he should wash it, or should I wear it with the strains-are
                these
                strains temporary or permanent. No ,not possible, I cant wear my own new shirt with strains on my own
                freshers , I had spent money not anyone else to look good with the shining shirt. I can also ask someone
                else for the shirt and had easily arranged it, but I decided to buy one.
                Then I took some major steps, to save the drowning titanic. I sent the images of strain to Saksham, and
                self
                washed the strained area, and had decided Saksham will again iron it for me tomorrow. All the steps were
                good but I feel little cheap while sending images of strain to Saksham , but I was my shirt and I don’t
                find
                anything wrong in it, if someone else would be at my place , he would have done the same thing or even
                harsher than this. And I don’t wannu to among the people who cant even speak for themselves.
                Then I slept feeling a little nervous, angry, frustrated and exited for tomorrow. The first thing I
                checked
                were the strains, thankfully they were gone, now once again Saksham ironed it and finally my shirt was
                ready
                to be wore by me. I wore it and looked perfectly fine , and obviously not like Ranbir Kapoor, with my
                first
                time in a formal outfit and as one of the funda says
                FUNDE ME KAISE KAPDE PHANNE CHAIYE?
                UJALI SHIRT , NICHLI PANT, SAFED MOJE AND KALE JUTE.
                I was wearing my UJALI shirt , and was ready for freshers.

                • Puri duniya mujhe ullu banati rehi , ki success hoti kya h aur milti kaise h. Koi bhi iss duniya me
                nehi
                chahata ki tum successful ho jao isliye charo or ek trap bichaya gaya h, the success paradox. Kuch
                akal-mand
                logo ne dimag lagaya ki , agar success sabko chaiye , aur ye bahut important h to kyu na iska matlab he
                badal de, kyu na ise ek aisi chiz bana de jo ye h he nehi, phir koi ise dhund he nehi payga aur bas yehi
                to
                hum dusro ke liye chate h. Isliye unhone success ko chupa diya ek pard eke piche. Ur duniya ko dikhaya
                ek
                jhut, jiska na chate hue bhi me bhi hissa tha, shayad abhi bhi hu , par ab mujhe kuch kuch dikhne laga
                h.
                Chalo phele me apko ye parde ke bare me batata hu. Ye parda , ek psycology ke roop me , hum sabhi ke man
                me
                bachpan se he baithaya gaya h, aur baki ka kam internet, youtube, insta , motivation, teachers ,aur baba
                kar
                rehe h . chalo apko is parde se milata hu.
                • Success come from sleepless nights.
                • Ek aisa step exist karta h jise lene se , elon-musk ban gaya, peter spiderman ban gaya,
                swami-vivekanand
                ban gay.
                • Pure din bas hardwork karo.
                • …
                Aur bhi bahut kuch h, har picture me dhikha ye jata h , ek insaan jise kuch banna hota h , kuch karna
                hota h
                phir ek gana ata h movie me aur gane ke sath-sath he 2 min me vo maggie ki tarah successful ho jata h.
                AJ
                tak kisi bhi hero ki success dhikhai he nehi gai h, use part ko zayada-tar ya to skip kar diya jata h,
                ya to
                ek gane me nipta diya jata h. Kyuki vo part boring hota h iseliye koi use dhikana pasand nehi karta,
                yaha
                tak ki success milne ke bad koi bhi apni success story me vo nehi batata. Islie hume, yani mujhe in
                movies
                ko dhekhte-dhekhte lagne laga ki bas kuch bada kadam uthana h, jisse ek din zindgi badal jay, kuch pana
                h to
                sleepless nights jinni hongi, aur aisa kya karu ki success jaldi mile. Playlist jaldi khatam kardu, kuch
                sikh raha hu to use 2x par sikh lu , aisa kya karu ki jald se jald me sab sikh jao aur paisa ane lage.
                Apne
                youtubers ki success story me kuch lines common jazarur suni hongi ki mene sleepless nights jagi h, pur
                pure
                din mehnat kari h ye vo phalana-dhimkana. Hum sabhi bhi apni life me se vo mehnat wala part hata dena
                chahte
                h, kyuki vo hume kabhi dhikhaya hi nhi gaya to hum, pata he nehi ki sabse zaruri to wahi tha, hume to
                bas
                bad ki success , lavish lifestyle, paisa, fan-following, expensive cars dhikai jati h. Bahut dino se me
                kuch
                soch raha tha ki, mujhe 1st me kuch aisa mil jay ki me famous ho jau, ya kuch bada kam karna h jisse log
                mujhe jane, kuch aise karna h ki paisa kamane lag jau. Pr kuch mila he nehi, me daily kuch karta hu, par
                man
                me jaldi ki iccha rehti h. par aj mujhe real-ise hua ki consistency, chote kadam, daily proper timely
                sleep
                chaiye bas. Mujhe kuch unique karna tha jisse me bhi apne hero tony stary aka iron man jaisa cool ban
                jau,
                utna expert ban jau, logo ko akad angrezi me attitude dhika saku, par ab pata chala h ki iron man movie
                se
                bhi ye scene missing tha ki tony itna genius kaise bana, use apne ye sare suit kab kitni der me , kitni
                mehnat karke , banay . Par uske bad ki chamak dhamak bahut thi. Par ab mujhe realise ho rah h ki dhire
                dhire
                kisi kam jo daily bahut lambe samay tak karne ke bad he hum genius banenge aur vo din bhi zarur ayga.
                Ek line mujhe warren buffet ki bahut acchi lagti h ki “MUJHE 100% YAKIN THA KI ME US DIN AMIR BAN JAUNGA
                ISLIYE MENE KABHI JALDI NEHI KARI”. Kuch bada , unique karne ki zarurat nehi h unique banne ke liye , ye
                sab
                sochna ki meri uniqueness h, consistency meri strength h, aur ab mene patience aur parseverance ko bhi
                shamil kar liya h. dhekhte h isme age aur konsi superpowers shamil hongi. Ha me to ye batana he bhul
                gaya hi
                hamare universe me bhi puper powers exist karti h bas vo utni cool nehi hoti jitni movies me hoti h
                jaise,
                flying, invisibility, spider man , batman, hulk, iron man,,,,,,,par vo hoti h consistency, … jo bhi mene
                upar bataya vo sabhi aur superheros bhi hote h jo inhe prapt kar lete h, abhi shayad mere pas bhi kuch
                powers ane lagi h, bhalay he ye thodi kamzor level par h, par kamse kam h to. Chalo aj ke liye itna he ,
                ab
                bad me kabhi milte h. TATA.

                After , having a successfully failed attempt on the mission to “never use Instagram” , although the
                mission
                was set by a 10th grade topper or batter to be called a nerd. The mission was a flop decision from the
                very
                beginning , but had a very sensible logic behind it, which a boy child could feel. At that age I hadn’t
                used
                the toxic app, surprisingly I was only available on whatsapp , not even I had a facebook account at that
                time. I could clearly remember that I was not 18 by then(the legal age to have any type of account) but
                some
                of the so called ‘bad girls’ of my class have it == this was what I thought , but the reality was truly
                opposite of this , every “chomu” of my class was having fake accounts on all social-media platforms
                since
                class 6th, 7th, or definitely from class 8th. .You all can clearly notice my nerdish concept of calling
                everyone “bad” who doesn’t follow my beliefs.
                Lets discuss why I was, not having a account the reason was the trend of reels , tick-tocks, short
                videos
                concept. Everyone whoever has a account on insta would try to do some of the shit to get famous or to
                get
                some likes.
                NOW ITS ME AND 2024, I don’t understand 2 things (actually I don’t get many but here I am sharing
                relevant
                2) why do girls dances half naked (I know they cant be full naked on this app so they become half)
                ,,,,,by
                half naked girls I mean girls who expose any of their body part , their beauty, their figure , or stuff
                like
                that to get some attention. Why are they doing so, do they want to be liked for their hot `and sexy
                moves,
                it isn’t even morally or ethically correct , is this how they are going to get successful or is this
                what so
                called gender equality for which they had fighted since decades.
                What will your kids learn when they will know what their mom used to do, to get non existing likes on a
                virtual platform, both the likes and the patform do not have a physical significance. Or those girls
                have
                lost their mind and had decided to flaunt their moves .LETS CLOSE THIS TOPIC FOR TODAY I AM NOT MATURE
                ENOUGH TO WRITE ON IT TODAY , 1ST I SHOULD TALK TO A GIRL ,AND GAIN SOME MORE SOPHISTICATED WORDS TO
                EXPRESS
                MY FEELINGS.
                The second thing is why people want to do show-off of everything , why they want to put every moment of
                their life on their story and posts. Don’t they belive on nazar. Or the reason which I think is the
                reason
                is that they want to make others look at their happy and lavish life , which in reality is obviously
                not,
                they want others envy them, for their happiness. But I found it extreamly opposite of this, after
                posting 2
                posts , and getting appreciation for them from my friends to whom I hadn’t talked bout on this topic ,
                wouldn’t it be fun when they don’t know what happened in the time since we meet months before, and I
                tell
                them all the story from mouth.i am leaving this topic also since I havnt hained some super heavy words
                and
                maturity to write on some serious issue.and aj ki raat me vo maza nehi a raha likhne me.

            <p class="sec1-text" id="learningfromjail">
                Today we have completed our first month at our college, MANIT BHOPAL. MANIT is famous for its ragging
                culture . I hadn’t heard about much hard ragging here- only intros, verbal abuse, threatening calls,
                funde
                and some slaps our fresh cheeks, which are new to MANIT. To protect us from the cruel versions of
                ragging
                which used to happen here we got some special protection from the administration, which is our new
                home==hostels.
                We have big hostels of about 3 floor high and contains 2 symmetrically built blocks, actually there are
                4
                similar blocks but we first year reside only in block C & D and our seniors, who score good cg in first
                year
                reside in the first 2 of them. You may think than how are we safe, don’t worry COW(chief of wardens) has
                arranged a boundary between the area, the boundary is itself not a boundary; It is the chain connection
                of
                teen (the sheet of iron used for making shed) fitted vertically .
                Apart from this division our hostel is surrounded by a real boundary too having wire fencing fitted
                above
                it, to a height comparable to an elephant ,so that no human being could cross it and a big iron door
                which
                was seldom caught open.
            </p>
            <p class="sec1-text" id="therise">
                This year was started with pain, jee mains 1st attempt was coming closer and closer then it just
                happened
                and I had scored 98.3 percentile in it as there was some major problem with the result, the papers of
                27th
                and 29th January were made very easy relative to others shift therefore people who had scored good marks
                in
                it had scored low percentiles. Now you must be thinking that I was unable to score 99 percentile because
                my
                exam was on either 27 or 29 but my exam was on 28th jan , the reason I was unable to achieve my aim is
                still
                unclear to me , but I guess it was as par as my hardwork and it was not too poor, so I was not sad(not
                being
                sad and being happy are 2 different things).
                And I had went to give my first jee mains with Abhishek’s father as both of us had same examination
                center
                in Gwalior so it was first decided Abhishek will go with us but in the midnight he called me and asked
                that
                is there some space in car, so that one of his friend could come . My dady don’t like these things , so
                the
                plan was flipped and then I was going with abhishek. We had reached at the center on time we had our
                lunch
                there and had decided to enter, before that, since mobile phones aren’t allowed in the exam ,we had
                given
                our mobile phone and all cash money to his father,then we both entered through the gate after which
                parents
                weren’t allowed. After some distance a security guard checked my admit card and told me that it was not
                in
                proper format and I had to reprint it. Thankfully printing facility was available there but but but I
                was
                not having money, nor my mobile and even Abhishek’s papa was missing I had tried finding him in the
                crowd
                but I was unable, the bigger problem was : I didn’t even knew his phone number why will I find any need
                or
                reason to learn mobile number of my friend’s father, even I don’t bother learning his mobile number too.
                what sould I do now. I was already so tensed and scared about my admit card and a new terror was seizing
                me.
                I give printing order to the printing wale bhaiya , and he was ready with the admit card but I didn’t
                have
                money to pay him . Then I told him my problem , so he asks me to call abhi’s papa but I don’t know his
                number- I muttered. Then after carefully analyzing the situation and the profit he made that day he gave
                me
                the admit card in free. Such a kind man. It was just my mummy and papa praying all throughout the time
                until
                I wasn’t home again. THAT DAY I GOT A LESSON THAT WHENEVER YOU GO WITH SOME STRANGERS ON A TRIP YOUR
                PAPERNTS MUST HAVE THEIR NUMBER, THEIR PARENT’S NUMBER AND THEIR ADDRESS. AND YOU SHOULD ALSO LEARN SOME
                IMPORTANT NUMBERS . Then I was allowed and my entry was succesfull . Then after giving the exam
                everybody
                was talking with the person’s next to their seat but I was silent and shy to talk to any stranger , then
                we
                were allowed to exit and I was thinking that In this crord of foolish jee aspirants how will I find abhi
                and
                his father but hopefully they were just at the place where we had lunch, and then we were in a new
                problem
                there were no taxi or auto available there to take us to the city or to the railway station then ,we had
                to
                walk for some 1-1.5 km to reach a spot where we can find taxi, but the god want some more fun, so he
                sent a
                full taxi, Abhi’s father sit near the taxi driver and we were made to sit at the back of the taxi.
                Sitting
                at the back of taxi doesn’t hurt much , it was very frequent for me to travel in back of a taxi with
                Roshan
                after giving mock test in Modi college in kota, but this time something special was waiting for me.
                There
                was excess heating at the bottom and I was feeling like I was sitting on a tawa for almost 30min and my
                back
                was ready as a burnt sandwich. The quota of problem didn’t end here , abhi is jain his father is jain,
                they
                don’t eat after the sun sets and our exam was in after noon so it was good night till now. Exam from
                2:30 to
                5:30 , 30 min to find them, 30 min in walk(in hunger),and 30 min in taxi ,it was almost 7-7:30 I was
                very
                hungry after the exam , hunger was at that level that I cant resist it now, even I cant resist it after
                giving exam but this time it was late latter lattest. I want food now so I asked abhi for food ,he asked
                his
                father but his father replied “chalo time par pahuch gay train lagi mili h” he means to say that I we
                ate
                food then we will miss the train and next train was 3 hrs later but since I had said these words and my
                father made him incharge of me. If he didn’t allowed to have me dinner to catch the train then it would
                be
                his cruelty and a mark on his mutual respect in the eye’s of my dady. I knew that he knew it perfectly
                so it
                was decided to have our dinner near railway staion as soon as possible and when abhi’s father was paying
                for
                my dinner then It would not make sense I abhishek don’t eat it. And abhi was also as hungry as me , so
                we
                both had dinner and had caught the train successfully . It was a passenger train and we were in general
                compartment of the train, my back was not very comfortable on the thick metallic benches without any
                coushioning. Then finally after fighting with 6 big problems my day was over , the train was late and we
                reavhed Shivpuri at 11 so from morning 6 to evening 11 the day was tiresome and never forgetting.
                Jee mains 1 was over and similarly jee mains 2 arrived , but this time I went there with dady and
                everything
                happened smoothly, he always wait for half an hour for me at the door , if any problem arrives he was
                there.
                The exam was over and thus time I was not in tention of finding him , as I knew that he hate crowd so he
                will be away form it somewhere else where there is not much crowd and there are few places like that at
                that
                time so I always found him easily. Then he made me drink chilled water(people of area call it ,like it)
                and
                a big glass of sugar cane juice and we in our own car drove back to Shivpuri.
                Actually I had messed it up, the stories of jee mains 1 and 2 had been exchanged but it doesn’t matter
                to me
                and even to you.
                Now comes jee advanced , I was prepared and we(me and dady) went there through car, we reached there on
                time
                and after following a long line I entered the center, and dady was constantly looking at me, to solve
                any
                problem as soon as it appears , but fortunately nothing happened and 1st 3 hrs of exam was over and next
                3
                hrs were left . I had bought lunch but it was peak summer time and we can’t stay outside the car for
                even a
                single minute but the car was more cooked and was not cooling down on full AC , we loosen our clothes,
                jeans
                and shirt had lunch in the car. We had some how found a place to park the car , but there was no shadow
                of a
                single tree, there was a big open ground but no piece of shadow, trees there were very thin they were
                unable
                to generate the shadow. But at the back side , of the ground there were some dense trees and a room type
                thing, everybody who saw those had clicked a thought to go there in search of shadow, now everybody was
                taking his car there but the place was already full and everybody had to return .Almost 20 cars went by
                and
                returned it was funny and some sort of nice entertainment with dady to watch them struggle and then
                return.
                Then again after following a lone queue I was once again checked and was allowed inside. The exam paper
                was
                tough this time, I had planned to score good marks in physics but this time physics came difficult and
                maths
                was relatively easy , finally the exam was over, we sat in our car , then dady asked me to eat something
                and
                I choose pav-bhaji (its my favourite dish) I ate it, it was not too poor , then I drank sugar-cane juice
                and
                we returned to Shivpuri, this marked the ending of a most important day of my life till then, and even
                till
                now, with 15 hrs of just sitting(2.5 hrs to Gwalior, 2.5 hrs to Shivpuri, 6 hrs exam, 1.5 hrs to wait
                for
                exam,1.5 hrs in car).
                Consequently the result arrives and I had just cleared the cutoff (my marks =112 and general cutoff was
                109
                marks, but obc cutoff was 96 marks) and I was happy with 23k rank. I was hoping for almost 118 marks and
                12k
                rank, but everything happens for a reason and I an here now in NIIT BHOPAL , since my rank was too poor
                to
                get in a good iit or even a good branch , therefore I had to choose NITB as my college.
                Once again bags were packed , and we left for Bhopal with no driver, It was almost 5hrs of driving but
                we
                reached there without any problem and on time. On the admission day the LRC is decorated and different
                counters are made for admission process , we began clearing each and every counter as fast as possible
                and
                there on the first day I saw Saumya, no as the name is of a girl but saumy is a boy, he was standing in
                the
                queue with a red face and was looking dangerous, bit who knew it that thid dangerous boy id exactly
                opposite
                and was going to be my roommate.
                Then I had called vedant to meet us, and he came and guided us for the upcoming process and the
                admission
                time was over and my admission too.
                After leaving LRC we saw a gadda-wala a senior who was selling gadda(matteress) , he has done some
                promotions and ads previously in the group of manit freshers. He was selling a combo of 8kg bed-sheeet
                with
                a pillow for 800 bucks but after some bargaining we persuaded him for 600 bucks and tada , we bought a
                bigger and a better gadda for the price of the smaller one , that too with a pillow. And now we followed
                the
                autowala who knew the way for H10D , which was allotted for me. And we arrived here and was looking for
                room
                209 , first time we were mistaken and we went into someone else’s room and then we find out our room ,
                but
                for my surprise Saumya with his family were already there his mummy was doing jhadu and paucha in the
                whole
                room and especially at saumya’s side. Ya they had decided that their son will live on the right side and
                his
                roommate on the left. I am still unable to figure out what was the advantage of that side , hopefully I
                would figure it out before 2nd year. Then I began bringing my luggage , bags, thelas and
                Kumble(Blanket).
                While dady was taking to them, they already told us that Saumya was a shy boy who never spoke much.Then
                when
                Saumya and his parents left. They had decided to stay one last night with their kid and would also visit
                some tourist places of Bhopal , I think the already knew it that Saumya would never go anywhere with his
                friends. Then after some calls mama(not real) who is a forest officer with 3 stars arrived with his
                father
                in law(a principle) to visit my room and hostel. Initially they examined the room and then had a convo
                for
                about about 1-1.5 hr with dady and me , trying to know each other. After the greeting and meeting were
                over
                and it was decided that dady was going to stat with them this night and will leave in the morning. Then
                they
                too left and I was alone in the room.
